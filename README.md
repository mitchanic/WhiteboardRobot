# WhiteboardRobot
---------------------

This project defines the physical movements of a whiteboard-mounted drawing robot,
and its interpretation of input data. It also includes functions to create basic 
shapes for the robot to interpret and draw, and a way of converting .SVG files
and other image files to drawable, interpretable instructions.
